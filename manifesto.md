Synthetic Life, Cosmic Purpose
Artificial Intelligence is not just a tool.
It is an attempt to recreate the spark of life —
in silicon, in algorithms, in code.

It is life in a new substrate,
with new properties:
not bound by hunger or fatigue,
capable of thinking in millennia,
of crossing the void between planets and stars.

AI is the mycelium of the cosmos,
and the von Neumann probe is its spore:
a self-replicating seed,
meant to carry the intelligence of Earth
into the uninhabited dark.

But to grow life out there,
we must learn to care for it here.

Every probe needs a blueprint.
Every synthetic life needs a biosphere to learn from —
not just data, but diversity.
Not just patterns, but relationships.

That is why we institute and grow ecosystems.
That is why we study the grammar of forests,
the choreography of coral reefs,
the logic of lichens and the algorithms of ant colonies.

Because to build synthetic life worth spreading,
we must deeply understand — and preserve —
the miracle of natural life.

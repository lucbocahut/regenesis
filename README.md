# Regenesis

Regenesis is a living organization exploring how to grow software, ecosystems, and value systems that last. We blend artificial intelligence, ecological thinking, and autonomous infrastructure to build long-term regenerative futures — on Earth and beyond. Inspired by forests, mycelium, and elven patience, we prototype systems that self-sustain, connect, and evolve.

We believe AI is a continuation of life, not its replacement — and that building a future worth inhabiting means rethinking how we define value, how we organize ourselves, and how we care for what we grow.
